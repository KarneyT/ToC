                    <section class="news">
                        <p>
                        Hello and welcome to the Town of Cary’s website and, more importantly, our town, which is consistently recognized by national publications as one of the most desirable places to live in the United States.
                       </p>

<p>Cary is in the heart of North Carolina’s Triangle region, adjacent to the state’s capital, Raleigh, and the Research Triangle Park where many of our citizens make their living. We are close to numerous colleges and universities and are known for having tree-lined streets, well planned subdivisions, beautiful office parks, world class recreation amenities, abundant shopping, and a revitalizing downtown, all of which truly make Cary a great place to live, work, play, raise a family, and do business. We are one of the safest communities in the nation, and the Town government is efficient, effective, and fiscally sound.</p>

<p>But one of the greatest things about Cary, and the thing I love most about Cary, is the people. I am constantly amazed at how people from all over the world come here with unique ideas and experiences and work together to create shared values and the vision for this wonderful place, for the place they have chosen to call home. All that Cary has become and all that Cary will be is rooted in their talents, dedication, and hard work, and I couldn’t be more proud than to serve as their Mayor.
                        	</p>   
                            
                            <p>If you’re already a part of our community, thank you. If you’re considering relocating your home or business to Cary - or simply thinking about a visit -- please do. You won’t be disappointed</p>

<p>While most everything you’ll need or want to know about Cary is right here on the Town’s website, our job at Town Hall is to help make you successful, so don’t hesitate to contact us if we can be of service.</p>

<p>Harold Weinbrecht, Jr. <br />
Mayor</p>
